# About 

ðŸš€ Galaxy â€“ My first python project âš¡

Galaxy is a Python project built with the Kivy framework, created as part of a course to learn the basics of Python programming. 
In this game, you pilot a spaceship that must follow a randomly generated route through the galaxy. The goal? Travel as far as possible while navigating the stars! 
This project helped me practice event handling, dynamic graphical rendering with Kivy, and basic gameplay logic. Itâ€™s a fun first step on my journey into game development with Python!
